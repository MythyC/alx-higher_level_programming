# REPO - ALX HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING

## DESCRIPTION
This repository contains codes written for the higher level programming languages at the ALX Software engineering course in conjunction with Holberton school of computer science. In these projects, i have learnt the Python programming language, and i have used skills acquired to solving numerous tasks which have been duly documented in this repo. simultaenously, I continued to expand my skills inC programming language and shell scripting, while advancing my knowledge
of Data Structures and Algorithm. This repo could serve as a source of learning material for aspiring Software engineer.

## PREREQUISITE
This repository is a continuation of [ALX-Low_level_programming](https://github.com/MythyC/alx-low_level_programming) and serve to build and refine my skill as a software engineer.
